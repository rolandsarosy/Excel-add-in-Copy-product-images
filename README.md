Getting Started
---------------

If you or your company already has an excel add-in:

- Copy the contents of the **frame** folder and add it to the existing creation subroutine
- Copy the .frx and .frm files from the **addin** folder and add it to the XLAM project

If this is the first time you'll use an excel add-in:

- Copy the contens from the **frame** folder and the .frx, .frm files from the **addin** folder and add both to a new VBA project
- Insert the .frm and .frx files into the project under *userforms*
- Save the project and exit the project editor
- Save the excel file as an Excel Macro-Enabled Add-In file (XLAM for short)
- Save and distribute the newly created file
- Every user should add this file to their excel client under settings/extensions

Note: Due to safety protocols of Microsoft Excel, if any extension is put on a server (even local) the extension will not function properly. It is advised that each user should store their own copy on their local computer
